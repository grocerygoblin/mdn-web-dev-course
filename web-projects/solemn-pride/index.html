        <p>Oftentimes, it can be difficult to see the good in the bad. This is because as humans, we are hardwired to simply lament when we are at our worst and go almost manic with happiness when we are at our best. It is what has kept us striving towards greatness throughout history. It is only every once in a while that the average human can find find peace in their misery, and even rarer yet for one to find a silver lining.</p>
        <p>But what of those countless sufferings where one cannot find any goodness? Those afflictions that deterioriate our sense of self, eradicate our hope, and steal all of our joy? What then, can we do, when we find ourselves in such a predicament?</p>
        <p>It's no coincidence that the cross of Jesus Christ is among the most prevalent of Christian imagery throughout the world: A man, 
            <ul>
                <li>covered head to toe in vicious wounds,</li>
                <li>face toward the ground,</li>
                <li>arms splayed,</li>
                <li>hands and feet nailed,</li>
                <li>and suspended upon a Roman crucifix.</li>
            </ul>
        This is no display of ordinary hardship, but rather the image of a man in his worldly body at it's pinnacle of physical torment, bleeding to death in front of his mother and a crowd of spectators.
        </p>
        <p>Leading up to this point, Jesus' cross was his own burden to bear. The Roman soldiers ordered him to carry it by himself, and only for part of the journey did Jesus recieve help, which he accepted reluctantly.</p>
        <p>There is something beautiful about the hardships we carry. They are sent from God, and give us meaning and purpose. For me, it is the dreaded reality of sober existence against a backdrop of poverty and mental illness in the family. It is my cross.</p>
        <p>Carry yours as I carry mine: with pride.</p>
